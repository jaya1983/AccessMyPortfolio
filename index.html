                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they
                travel,
                shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your
                visibility
                and find the right customers for your business.An “About Me,” also known as a blurb, is a short piece of
                writing that informs
                your reader about your professional background, key accomplishments, personal values and any brands you
                may be associated with.
                Personal websites, social media profiles and company directories often feature “About Me” sections.
                A blurb is an opportunity to quickly give important details about yourself to potential business
                contacts like clients, vendors,
                employers or anyone who wants to get to know you better.
                <br />

                “About Me” writings can vary in length, tone, content and point of view.
                For example, a social media blurb might be shorter, more informal and written with first-person “I”
                statements.
                Blurbs for a company website might include more details, use a professional tone and show your full
                name.
                However, you have a lot of freedom in choosing the length and style of your “About Me.”
                <br />
                Blurbs are important because they quickly give potential business contacts the most relevant information
                about you.
                Because an “About Me” can be less formal than a candidate profile on a resume,
                it can also be a chance to use humor or a personal story to help the reader become familiar with you.
